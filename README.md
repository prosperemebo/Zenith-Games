## Introduction

Zenith Tech is a dynamic and user-friendly tech listing site developed as a portfolio project for the ALX Software Engineering Foundations program. The project showcases my proficiency in Python programming and web scraping techniques. Inspired by my personal experience with online shopping and dissatisfaction with the user interface of existing platforms, I aimed to create a platform prioritizing user experience and usability.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Leveraging Python's robust libraries, Zenith Tech automatically scrapes product data from [Cheap Games NG](https://www.cheapgamesng.com), a website I frequently use for purchasing games and tech products.
  
- **Improved User Interface**: Unlike its source of inspiration, Zenith Tech prioritizes a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface. Efforts have been made to enhance user experience and streamline navigation.

## Why Zenith Tech?

- **Proof of Concept**: Zenith Tech serves as a proof of concept, illustrating the potential improvements in user experience and usability when compared to existing platforms like Cheap Games NG.

- **Portfolio Showcase**: This project demonstrates my skills in web development, data scraping, and UI/UX design, making it an ideal addition to my portfolio as a software engineering professional.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for web scraping and backend development.
  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development for creating the user interface.
  
- **Flask**: Micro web framework used for building the application.
